#### Back Cover:

> Midnight has a heart, a powerful mind, and is a fierce fighter. "I don't love my guns, but I need 'em," he says, willing to do anything to defend his family, the women he loves, and his business and property. African born, Midnight is the son of a wealthy Islamic African family. When his father's empire is attacked, he and his mother come to America and end up living in the Brooklyn projects.

You will meet characters whom you've never encountered before. The intricate storytelling will move your heart soul, and change your life forever.
