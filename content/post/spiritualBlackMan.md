### 2. *Message to the Blackman in America* by Elijah Muhammad

This book is the most powerful book on the list. It will change you so make sure that you are ready. Elijah Muhammad was extremely particular with his words and made explicit requests to never alter a word of his original print. 60 years later and predictions from this book are still coming true. It will not all make sense at first, but it is all true. Again make sure to buy Black or POC when looking for [*Message to the Blackman in America*](https://malikbooks.com/shop/ols/products/message-to-the-blackman-in-america-by-elijah-muhammad). Here's a link to other [Black-owned bookstores](https://nonamebooks.com/Bookstores).

"Elijah Muhammad has been able to do what generations of welfare workers and committees and resolutions and reports and housing projects and playgrounds have failed to do...He has done all these things" ~ James Baldwin in his book, **The Fire Next Time**
