### 1. *Asafo A Warrior's Guide to Manhood* by Mwalimu K. Bomani Baruti

![Asafo Cover](/images/asafoCover.png)

#### Back Cover:

> Asafo is an in-depth Afrikan centered discussion of the requirement of Afrikan manhood. In it, the author clearly lays out our sources of power and the tools that must be acquired, mastered and used if we are to reclaim our correct role as warrior scholars in the battle to provide safe, sacred and empowering spaces for our families and communities. It gives specific consciousness raising guidelines for our nationbuilding effort, weeding out those compromising ideas and forces which have kept us confused over whether we want ot be powerful or just influential in this world. This book is a very important tool in African men's efforts to help ReAfrikanize our people. As the table of contents indicate, there is strong emphasis on building functional educational instituations, developing a dynamic sense of group consciousness through elevating one's self'consciousness, male rites of passage programs and warrior's mental preparation. In addition, we are taken through the difficult process of growing from being merely other-directed, apathetic individual consumers to powerful, mission-directed men in thought, word and deed. Asafo closes with an extensive collection of revolutionary quotes that specifically work to define, direct and heal every Afrikan man's warrior scholar spirit.

### 2. *Blood in my Eye* by George Jackson

![Blood in My Eye Cover](/images/bloodCover.png)

#### Back Cover:

> *Blood in My Eye* was completed only days before its author was killed. George Jackson died on August 21, 1971 at the hands of San Quentin prison guards during an alleged escape attempt. At age eighteen George Jackson was convicted of stealing seventy dollars from a gas station and was sentenced to one year to life--eleven years--in the California prison system, seven of them in solitary confinement. In prison he read widely and transformed himself into an activist and political theoretician who defined himself as a revolutionary. As a revolutionary he found meaning in his daily prison existence. And it was in that context that he came to terms with the death of his younger brother Jonathan--killed while attempting to free three Black prisoners from custody at a California courthouse.\
Jackson's first book *Soledad Brother: The Prison Writings of George Jackson*, published in 1970, earned him the respect and admiration of progressive people around the world. But even before that book, Jackson was a legendary figure inside the California prison system, known to all as a uncompromising individual. A fellow prisoner described him as "a very beautiful example of what a Black man should be."\
In a letter to Angela Davis, Jackson wrote, "If my enemies, your enemies, prove stronger [than us,] at least I want them to know that they made one righteous African man extremely angry." On another occasion he wrote, "They'll never count me among the broken men." As *Blood in My Eye* affirms, George Jackson remained unbroken.



### 3. *Black Son Rising! The Reawakening of the warrior DNA in Black men* by TC Carrier

### 5. Message to the Blackman in America by Elijah Muhammad

This book is the most powerful book on the list. It will change you so make sure that you are ready. Elijah Muhammad was extremely particular with his words and made explicit requests to never alter a word of his original print. 60 years later and predictions from this book are still coming true. It will not all make sense at first, but it is all true. Again make sure to buy Black or POC when looking for [*Message to the Blackman in America*](https://malikbooks.com/shop/ols/products/message-to-the-blackman-in-america-by-elijah-muhammad). Here's a link to other [Black-owned bookstores](https://nonamebooks.com/Bookstores).
